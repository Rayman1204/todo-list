# Create Todo React App easily with Material UI

Delete all default mark up.

For components create folder #components in #src folder and place there your react components.
In my project you can see: Form.jsx, FormInput.jsx, List.jsx.
You can create as many components as you want and name it how you like.

In this project Material-UI is used.
To install run:
<br />
`npm install @material-ui/core`

Material-UI was developed based on the Roboto font.
The Roboto font will not be automatically loaded into Material-UI.
*So be sure to install it.*

To install run:
<br />
`npm install fontsource-roboto`

Then import it in "index.js". To do so write in "index.js":
<br />
`import 'fontsource-roboto'`;

To use icons run:
<br />
`npm install @material-ui/icons`

To begin:
<br />
`npx create-react-app my-app`
<br />
`cd my-app`
<br />
`npm start`
